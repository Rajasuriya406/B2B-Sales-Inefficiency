# B2B Sales Analytics — Revenue Concentration & ICP Optimization

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a B2B sales pipeline to identify revenue concentration risks, evaluate sales performance drivers, and define a data-backed Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
The objective was to move beyond surface-level metrics (top performers, win rates) and identify what truly drives revenue growth using business metrics.

The analysis covers $10M in total revenue across sales reps, products, deal stages, and customer segments.




## Business Problem

Despite healthy overall performance, leadership observed that revenue growth was not scaling evenly across the sales organization.

-The key business questions were:

-Is revenue dependency driven by sales skill gaps?

-Are win rates or deal sizes the primary revenue drivers?

-Which customer segments truly define the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)?

-Where does revenue risk exist if top performers leave?



## Insights summary (TL;DR)

-50% of revenue ($5.04M) is generated by just 10 sales reps

-Win rates are consistent across all rep segments (≈60–65%)

-Deal size, not win rate, is the primary revenue driver

-Large enterprises (>2,000 employees) generate ~66% of total revenue

Revenue imbalance is caused by account allocation & ICP alignment, not sales execution




## Key Insights & Business Interpretation

### 1.Revenue Concentration Risk:

-Total revenue: $10M

-Top 10 reps: $5.04M (~50%)

-Remaining 20 reps: ~$5M

Business terms:
Revenue is highly concentrated, with Top 10 employees Closing 50%($5M USD) creating an organizational risk,however the problem is not skill gap  which is explained below.

                                                              Revenue by Sales Rep 




## 2.Sales Rep Performance: No Skill Gap

Insight (Win Rate):

-Overall avg win rate: 65.5%

-Range: 52.2% – 70%

-Top: 62.4%

-Normal: 64.1%

-Low: 52.5%

Business terms:
65% percent of the deals are closed in average indicates efficiency regardless perfomance tier, so revenue differencers are not caused by execution quality or sales skills.

                                                           Win Rate by Performer Segment





## 3️.Deal Size Drives Revenue Inequality

Insight (Avg Deal Size):

-Overall avg: $2,398

-Low performers: $1,799

-Normal performers: $2,505

-Top performers: $2,676

Business Meaning:
Top reps generate more revenue because they handle larger-value accounts, not because they close better.
This points to account quality and ICP allocation as the root issue.

## 4️. Pipeline Health Is Strong

Pipeline Distribution:

-Won: 48%

-Lost: 28%

-Engaging: 18%

-Prospecting: 28%


Business Meaning:
A 48% win rate indicates a healthy B2B pipeline.
Loss rates are normal and do not signal pipeline leakage or sales inefficiency.

                                                   Deal Stage Distribution





## 5️.ICP Analysis: Clear Revenue Signal

Revenue by Company Size:

-Large (>2,000 employees): $6.59M

-Mid (500–2,000): $2.41M

-Small (<500): $1.00M



Revenue by Company Revenue Band:


-Mid (500M–2.5B): $4.35M

-High (>2.5B): $3.80M

-Low (<500M): $1.85M


ICP  :
Large enterprises with mid-to-high annual revenue drives $6.5M  USD, clearly indicated deal  deal size,not win probability—drives revenue growth.

## Final Business Problem :

The core issue is misalignment between account allocation and revenue potential, not sales execution.

Sales reps perform consistently, but high-value ICP accounts are concentrated among a few reps, limiting scalability and increasing revenue risk.




### Strategic Recommendations
 
 1. Rebalance Account Allocation

Distribute high-value ICP accounts across more reps

Reduce dependency on top 10 performers


 2️. Redefine ICP Targeting

-Prioritize large, mid-to-high revenue enterprises
-De-emphasize low-revenue, small accounts for growth teams

 
 3. Focus Training on Deal Expansion

-Upselling & enterprise deal structuring
-Not conversion tactics (already strong)

 
 4. Optimize Product Mix

-Push high deal-size products
-Bundle or reposition low-value offerings




## Analytical Approach

Analytical Approach (End-to-End)

### 1.Data Understanding


-Reviewed raw CRM sales data (pipeline, sales reps, products, accounts)

-Identified key business metrics: revenue, win rate, deal size, pipeline stages



### 2.Data Cleaning (SQL)


-Cleaned and validated data in PostgreSQL

-Handled nulls, duplicates, and inconsistent deal stages

-Ensured only closed-won deals contribute to revenue



### 3.Exploratory Analysis (SQL + Python)


-Used SQL for aggregation and segmentation

-Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) to analyze distributions and outliers

-Identified revenue concentration and deal size patterns




### 4.Feature Engineering


-Created sales rep performance segments

-Engineered win rate, average deal size, ICP attributes

-Built analytical views for repeatable analysis




### 5.Analysis & Insights


-Tested whether revenue differences were driven by skill or deal value

-Analyzed pipeline health and ICP contribution using business metrics




### 6.Visualization & Storytelling


-Built Tableau dashboards focused on decision-making, not exploration

-Visualized revenue concentration, deal size vs win rate, ICP performance



### 7.Business Recommendations


Framed insights in terms of revenue risk, scalability, and growth levers
